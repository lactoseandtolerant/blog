### First Impression
I won't lie. I didn't know what the heck stracciatella was before buying this guy. It looked fancy and was peanut butter so what the heck. Oh and the container looked cool.

### Texture
The first thing I noticed were the ice crystals on the very top. Bummer. Ice sucks on ice cream but after I scraped off the ice I was pretty happy with the texture. It was fairly rich, thick and creamy. It's thickness isn't rock hard like some Ben & Jerry's. It was very scoopable but not too soft like soft serve ice cream. This guys consistency is pretty much spot on. The little specs of chocolate break up the creaminess a bit, tough I'm not quite sure if it works as well as intended.

### Flavor
The peanut butter base is pretty decent. Certainly better than [Blue Bunny's Peanut Butter Panic]({% post_url  2015-12-28-ice-cream-bb-peanutbutter-panic %}) but not quite as good as [Haagen Daz's Peanut Butter Pie]({% post_url 2015-12-01-ice-cream-haagen-das-peanut-butter-pie%}). I wish there was a little more peanut butter flavor. It reminded me of a fancier Breyers' Peanut Butter Cup, which isn't a great thing. The chocolate flakes seem fine but are too small to add any significant flavor.


### Going back for more?
Nah. It wasn't bad, just not nothing special. It has a great consistency though.
