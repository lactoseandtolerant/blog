### First Impression
The quest for a decent replacement to my favorite chocolate ice cream continues. This time I try my very first Baskin Robbins Pint. I never went to Baskin Robbins as a kid so I really didn't know what to expect. These pints were about a dollar cheaper than the premium pints at the grocery store so I was hoping the price wasn't a reflection of quality

### Texture
This pint was a strange combination of dense and fluffy. The white chocolate mousse ice cream lived up to its name and had the texture of a frozen mousse but much thicker. The texture reminded me of Kroger's Private Selection ice creams. It took a little getting used to but I think I liked it.

### Mixins
Well...there are no mixins...sooo....um yeah. I like my ice cream to have a bunch of stuff in it but I can forgive the lack of mixins if the flavor of the base makes up for it.

### Flavor
Nope. The flavor doesn't make up for it. The milk chocolate ice cream was so-so. It has that malty hot chocolate taste rather than real chocolate. I am still waiting for a chocolate ice cream that actually tastes like chocolate. The white chocolate mousse ice cream did taste like white chocolate but that wasn't all that exciting to me. White chocolate is cool in cookies but it's not really my thing when it comes to ice cream.

### Buy Again?
Nope. I'll give points for texture but no mixins and no flavor makes for a boring pint.
