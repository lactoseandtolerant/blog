### First Impression
The quest for a decent replacement to my favorite chocolate ice cream continues. I miss you Blue Bunny Chocolate Seduction!

In all seriousness I had high expectations for this pint. It's Haagen Dazs so you expect quality. I hadn't had their Trio line before so I really didn't know what to expect.

### Texture
Pretty thick and creamy. This is what you would expect from Haagen Dazs. The Belgian chocolate ribbon is hard. It reminds me of the magic shell stuff that hardens within seconds when you pit it on ice cream.

### Mixins
Nothin'. I mean they mixed two different flavors together, and I guess the crispy ribbon is technically a mixin but this is pretty boring stuff.


### Flavor
What can I really say here. This pint sucked. It is soooo bland. The milk chocolate tastes like the malty chocolate ice cream we have come to expect with chocolate ice cream. The white chocolate has no flavor. It's like it's sucking away some of the milk chocolate flavor. The crispy layer is so thin that you can't even taste it.

### Buy Again?
Not a chance. I am harder on chocolate ice creams than most other flavors so take this rating with a grain of salt. This, however, is easily the worst Haagen Dazs flavor I have ever had. It literally tastes like nothing. I'll give some points for texture but thats about it.
