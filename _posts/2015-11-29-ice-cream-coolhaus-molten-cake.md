### First Impression
This little guy was expensive. I decided to go out on a limb and buy this $7.50 pint while shopping at Fields Foods. My expectations were pretty high so I was a little dissapointed to open up the lid and see a small amount of ice crystals on top.

### Texture
The texture was smooth. Probably one of the smoother ice creams I have tasted recently. There are little chunks of cake mixed in but, unfortunately, the quantity was very small. I also couldnt really find the supposed swirl.

### Flavor
Meh. It has the smoothness going for it but it tastes like any other decent chocolate ice cream. There really isn't anything to distinguish it from something like Haagen Daz's basic chocolate. The lack of substantial mixins made it a disappointment.

### Going back for more?
Not a chance, especially at that price.
