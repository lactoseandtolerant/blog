### First Impression
I don't remember what ran through my head when I first saw this truck. It was bright yellow and had the words "Korean" and "BBQ", so I was basically sold. They haven't been around too long, but they immediately attracted a decent sized following. I used to see them downtown at least twice a week initially but they seemed to have started exploring other parts of the city.

### Food
K-Bop or "Korean Bop" simply means Korean meal. In this case it is rice, sweet potato noodles and your choice of BBQ meat. It's simple but quite delicious. I have been obsessed with the sweet potato noodles. They have a chewy texture that isn't for everybody, but I find them enjoyable. Their choice of meats should be familiar to most asian food lovers. My go to is the spicy chicken bop (gangam style), Their pork katsu is also quite good.


### Value
The prices are reasonable. They run from $7 to $9 a bowl, which in my opinion is where food truck prices should be. You get a good portion of rice, noodles and meat and you also can double the meat for $2 more.

### Going back again?
Every time they are out there.
