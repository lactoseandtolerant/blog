I like to cook and believe it or not, I make a lot more than ice cream. To prove this, I will be chronicling any interesting foods that I make each month. Let's get this started with what I have been up to this month.

### Spicy Thai Peanut Noodles with Chicken

This might be cheating a little because I think I actually made this at the end of January. I used to visit a small Thai restaurant called Okii Mama when I live in CoMo. They had some of the best peanut noodles I have ever had, primarily because they were completely drenched in delicious peanut sauce. This was my copycat attempt. It was technically my third go around and it turned out great. I learned a little bit more about working with coconut milk. It could have been a little spicier but the peanut sauce was on point.

### Bulgogi, Sweet Potato Noodles and Rice

My girlfriend and I decided to alternate making one meal a week from a specific cuisine each month. The first cuisine we chose was Asian and by "we" I mean me, because I already had a leg up with my peanut noodles. I am currently obsessed with *Jappchae* or Korean sweet potato noodles so I chose Korean. This was an attempt to recreate some Korean dishes I have been trying from near by food trucks. It consists of Japanese sushi rice, sweet potato noodles, stir fry veggies and bulgogi(Korean BBQ beef). It turned out great, maybe even better than the peanut noodles.

### Mushroom, Onion and Cheese Omelette, Sweet Potato Homefries and Bacon

I whipped this guy up for brunch this morning. Actually, Rachel made the bacon so it wasn't all me. The omelettes are a staple in my brunch repertoire, but the sweet potato home fries are something new. Sweet potato fries are a little tricky because of their high moisture content. I decided to fry these up for a few minutes then baked them for about 20 minutes. We also threw in some chopped up bacon to switch it up a bit. They came out pretty good, but I might add a little sugar next time to crisp them up a little more.
