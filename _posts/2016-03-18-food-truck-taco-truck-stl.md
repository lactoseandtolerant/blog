### First Impression
This food truck is what I expect a food truck to look like. It's boring, poorly designed and very green. If I were to see this truck next to something like [Slide Piece]({% post_url 2016-02-25-food-truck-slide-piece %}), I would pick this truck every time based on looks. There are a lot of taco based food trucks around so you have to be pretty good to keep people coming. I noticed these guys seem to be around a lot. They have at least two trucks so maybe that's the reason. On to the goods...

### Food
First and foremost, tacos from this truck kinda suck. There isn't anything special going on here. You get three tortillas, some meat, cheese and pico de gallo. They have a counter full of trimmings but the tacos here are basically something you could throw together at home. What doesn't suck is their big burrito. It's not too heavy on the stomach and tastes fresh. They used to serve it with a heartier style of tortilla chips, but recently switched to something more run of the mill. I would definitely score them higher if they switched back.


### Value
This truck scores pretty high on value. $8 gets you your choice of three tacos, nachos supreme, a quesadilla or the big burrito. While the tacos are cheaper than some of the competition, save your money and get the big burrito.

### Going back again?
If there isn't anything else out there, and only for the burrito.
