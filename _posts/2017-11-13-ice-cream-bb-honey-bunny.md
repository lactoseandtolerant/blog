### First Impression
I can't say honey-flavored ice cream is on the top of my list of ice cream flavors. Sure, honey is delicious, but I like my honey on toast or between many layers of filo dough. I'm not even sure why I bought this ice cream. It wasn't calling my name at all. Needless to say, my expectations were low.

### Texture
Classic Blue Bunny. The base is premium but not super premium. It's thicker than Breyers or Edy's but lighter than Haagen Daz. It is creamy and pleasant. The caramel swirls melt into the base. It's typical Blue Bunny caramel; gooey and a little syrupy. The graham cracker swirl is nice and gritty. It's held together well and isn't dusty or simply a bunch of specks sprinkled throughout the base.

### Mixins
The mixins here are all swirls. Like a lot of Blue Bunny flavors, they are concentrated in the middle of the half gallon. Overall it's a decent amount as long as you aren't expecting Ben & Jerry's level of mixins.

### Flavor
Man, you know what...they nailed it. The base tastes just like honey but not in a cloying kinda way. The more you eat the base the less pronounced the flavor is. It's a good base for mixins. The caramel is what you would expect. Honestly, I have never thought Blue Bunny does the best caramel. It's ok, but not great. The graham cracker swirl is where it's at. Man oh man is it good. It's nice and sugary. It kind of reminds me of the crust of a nice cheesecake.

### Buy Again?
Yeah. It's likely that this limited run will be over by the time I want to get it again, but yeah, it's a good flavor. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.
