### First Impression
[Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Fudge Brownie]({% post_url 2016-02-22-ice-cream-bj-chocolate-fudge-brownie %}) didn't do so well against my [Homemade Triple Chocolate]({% post_url 2016-01-16-homemade-triple-chocolate %}). So I decided to pit this pint up against my [Homemade Bourbon Pecan Pie]({% post_url 2016-02-07-homemade-bourbon-pecan-pie %}). My last review taught me that store bought just doesn't compare to homemade. I previously read that was the case but I didn't expect such a big difference. I gave the [Culinaria's Peanut Butter Cup]({% post_url 2015-12-28-ice-cream-culinaria-pb %}) one of my highest ratings so far so there is hope. This pint is also pretty high in calories (300) for a butter pecan, so I hoped it would translate to good flavor.

### Texture
The base is thick and smooth. It is inline with some of the high end ice cream brands. There is also a good amount of pecans to break up the base. I gotta give the Culinaria credit, they produce the same quality ice cream as a Ben & Jerry's but for almost half the cost.

### Flavor
Unfortunately the overall flavor is nothing special. I haven't eaten butter pecan ice cream in a while and now I remember why. It's just a slightly better version of vanilla ice cream with pecans mixed in. This pint isn't bad by any means. The base is buttery and the pecans taste pretty good. The issue is that I don't really dig butter pecan anymore. That and my [Homemade Bourbon Pecan Pie]({% post_url 2016-02-07-homemade-bourbon-pecan-pie %}) absolutely destroys this. I actually tasted both side by side and it wasn't even close. I will give the Culinaria some credit though. For a butter pecan, it is pretty solid. Just not my thing anymore.

### Going back for more?
Nope. I'm kinda over butter pecan.
