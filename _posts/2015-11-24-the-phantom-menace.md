I hate  Jar Jar Binks. He is annoying, clumsy and useless. I completely forgot how big a role he plays in The Phantom Menace.

Maybe it is because I was so enamored with the film
when it first came out. The first trailer, foggy mysterious scenes filled
with weird aliens walking through the mist, is etched into my memory. I remember news stations doing small featurettes, and everyone going bonkers (myself
included). I remember seeing Darth Mauls dual lightsaber and how my knees buckled
because I couldn't handle the awesomeness. Much like how A New Hope was the first
taste to alot of people the late 70's, The Phantom Menace was my true entrance to Star Wars
hysteria. Sure, I had seen the original trilogy countless times, but this was the
first time I was going in unprepared; no one knew how the universe would be expanded
and to me that was exciting.

Fast forward to late 2015 and I am re-watching The Phantom Menace in preparation
for the next big chapter in Star Wars. How does it hold up to my initial viewing
over 15 years ago? Well...I hate Jar Jar Binks. Jar Jar almost ruins the entire
movie. Almost!

For such an epic franchise, the movie began with a relatively
insignificant story. I never really felt engaged with the trade federations blockades
and clumsy droid soldiers. The introduction of the Jedi saved what
would have been a pretty bland debut. It helps that Ewan Mcgregor(Obi Wan Kenobi) and
Liam Neeson(Qui Gon Jinn) are both in the movie.

Obi Wan and Qui Gon's initial trip to the Gungan city appeared to exist only to
validate the existence of Jar Jar Binks. Jar Jar was infuriating to watch. He was clearly
there for comic relief, but I sometimes wondered if George Lucas simply wanted to play
with his big expensive cgi toys. An entire city of cgi Jar Jar look alikes seemed to
confirm my assumption. The trip out of the city, while more
interesting, was one big unnecessary action sequence. These were probably my least favorite sequences of the movie.

Things got significantly better when the Jedi met Queen Amidala. Natalie Portman
did a commendable job portraying the queen. Her costumes are also worthy of note.
They are superbly done and sometimes felt more alien than the actual aliens around her(Jar Jar Binks). The
droid invasion and consequently, our heros fleeing to Tatooine sped up the pace of the story.

>Amidalas costume and makeup were compelling

For as good a job Portman did as Amidala, Jake Lloyd did the opposite as
Anakin. He really was miscast. Anakin is supposedly the most complex character
in all of Star Wars and we got Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen to play him...
Bummer. To his credit, Lloyd came across as a better actor than Christensen did
in the later movies.

The film slowed down a bit with all the talk of freeing slaves and midi-chlorians (
a completely unnecessary inclusion) but things picked up again with the pod race. If you
are going to insist on doing action sequences for the sake of doing action sequences, then you better
do it right. The pod race did it right. It was and is still one of my favorite
race/chase scenes.

Lucas managed to maintain a good pace from this point on. The quick glance of Darth
Maul. The first look at Coruscant. The Gungans going to war. All of these sequences
flowed together alot better than the earlier parts of the film. The movies' political pieces
felt less believable than the action sets, but this was not shocking after recalling how bad
episode 2 and its political mess was.

The final encounter with Darth Maul was far and away the best part of the entire film.
I could recommend the film for this scene alone. It had, in my opinion, what is
still the best Jedi duel in Star Wars. Obi Wan waiting impatiently
for the energy barrier to turn so he can kick the crap out of Darth Maul was fantastic.
It was believable action storytelling as well as convincing special effects.

While some of the other special effects in the The Phantom Menace
appear a bit dated, the overall look and cinematography align much closer to the original
trilogy than that of episodes two and three. The greater use of practical effects makes this
movie feel more like Star Wars. The introduction of Obi wan and his master, the encounter with
Darth Maul combined with exciting pod racing overcame a bland performance by the trilogy's main
character as well as the completely useless Jar Jar Binks.
