### First Impression
The journey for a decent replacement to my favorite chocolate ice cream(Blue Bunny Chocolate Seduction) continues. The next contestant is from Private Selection. Private Selection is Kroger's premium ice cream brand. This is actually the second private selection flavor that I have tried. The first was their black raspberry chocolate chunk. I was surprised how much I liked that pint so my hopes for this flavor were pretty high. I also read several posts about this flavor being legit so that raised expectations a little more.

### Texture
The base had the same smooth, fluffy but dense texture of their black raspberry chocolate chunk. It isn't as dense as Ben & Jerry's or Haagen Dazs, but it definitely beats the pants off Edy's or Breyers. It's very similar to the Baskin Robbins World Class Chocolate. The best way to describe it is like a dense, smooth mousse. I actually think this is the sweet spot for ice cream. I don't have to let it sit out to warm up so it is scoopable but it doesn't melt as fast as other brands. The fudge swirl is dense, chewable and thankfully, not gooey.

### Mixins
Here is where things get interesting. I was expecting this guy to have some peanut butter cups or chocolate chunks because of the "moose tracks" label. Well, it does not. Private Selection has three different moose tracks flavors, two of them have chocolate bases and all of them have similar names. I guess I should have paid more attention. This flavor is basically just chocolate ice cream with swirls of fudge ribbons. It also has what I call the Blue Bunny dilemma. If you buy a Blue Bunny flavor with a lot of mixins you will soon find out that the top third of the container usually doesn't have a lot of mixins. The good stuff usually doesn't show up until you get to the middle. Well, this guy has the same problem. I was honestly disappointed with the mixins when I first opened up the container. I almost wrote this flavor off entirely. I'm glad I didn't because things completely changed when I hit the middle of the container.

### Flavor
Again, disappointment...well...mostly. The base has that fake malty, chocolate milk flavor most chocolate ice creams have with a small exception. I think I tasked coffee? It was subtle and fades away very quickly but there is something a little different about this base. I wish it lingered a little longer because it would have made the base a bit more interesting. The fudge swirl is nice. It is sweet but not quite Hersheys milk chocolate sweet. I can't really find fault with it.

### Buy Again?
You know...I don't know. This guy has a serious Jekyll and Hyde thing going on. The first half of this ice cream would have rated a 6 at the most. It was pretty bland and had little mixins. The second half is actually pretty good and would rate closer to an 8. It is the closest a chocolate flavor has gotten to Blue Bunny's Chocolate Seduction. Would I buy it again? Maybe. If I could give the first half to someone else or just get some chunks of chocolate or brownies to throw in there to mix things up then Yeah I might. With that said, I have to rate whats in the container and it's a mixed bag.
