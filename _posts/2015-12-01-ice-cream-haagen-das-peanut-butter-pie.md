### First Impression
I have been on a quest for the best peanut butter ice cream. I love peanut butter and have three different kinds in my kitchen. That fact should give you an idea about how picky I can get when it comes to peanut butter. I can't remember where I read about this Haagen Das flavor but I decided to give it a try. I hadn't had real peanut butter pie up until recently so I didn't really know if this would taste like peanut butter or some whipped creamy pie pilling. I also wasn't so sure about the chocolate looking streaks.

### Texture
The base is pretty smooth. None of that airy non-sense you get with lower quality brands (e.g. Breyers).
The chocolate is more cakey than crusty. I had never eaten real peanut butter pie before having this guy so this really didn't bother me. I could see people wanting something similar to a graham cracker like texture.
There is also a nice swirl of peanut butter mixed throughout the base.

### Flavor
The base has a pretty solid peanut butter flavor. It might be the best peanut butter base I have had recently. Most other peanut butter ice creams have more of a vanilla base with a hint of peanut butter. This guy has a fairly strong peanut butter flavor. I could stand to have an even stronger flavor, but this is pretty good. The peanut butter swirl and chocolate streaks add a good amount of variation.

### Going back for more?
Yes. probably the best peanut butter base I have had.
