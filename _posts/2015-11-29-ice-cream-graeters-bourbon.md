### First Impression
I got this guy at Dierbergs expecting it to be chocolate. Well, I was completely off. It has a ton of mixins, which was a pleasant surprise.

### Texture
The texture of the base was decent. It was smooth but not a smooth and creamy as the [Coolhaus Molten Chocolate Cake]({% post_url 2015-11-29-ice-cream-coolhaus-molten-cake %}). The amount of stuff thrown in breaks up the base quite a bit so that probably help interms of smoothness

### Flavor
I initially thought this had a vanilla or butter pecan base but there is a distinctive alcoholic aftertaste. It turns out the base is "Kentucky Bourbon". It works well but man, there is a lot of stuff going on here. Not only does the base have a little alcohol, the chocolate has even more. There are chunks of dark chocolate sprinkled everywhere, and after each bite you get a little blast of bourbon.
Throw in the pecans and it is basically madness.

### Going back for more?
Yes. I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know that I would buy it a lot, but if I am somehow in the mood for boozy ice cream then definitely.
