### First Impression
I was pretty pumped to try this Ben & Jerry's flavor. I really liked [Trader Joe's Speculoos ice cream]({% post_url  2015-11-26-ice-cream-tj-speculoos %}), so why not try the Ben & Jerry's version. The first thing I noticed was the core. Ben and or Jerry are not playing around. This is a big boy core. As I dug in, the size of the core got bigger; this core is definitely bigger than their [peanut butter flavor]({% post_url 2015-12-01-ice-cream-bj-pb-core %})

### Texture
The base is thick and creamy (as you would expect). The speculoos pieces are both cakey and chewy. They provide a nice contrast to the ice cream. They also add a little bit of grittiness to the its smoothness. The core is also smoother than their peanut butter core which was a little surprising.

### Flavor
This guy actually has two base flavors; vanilla and caramel. I didn't find the caramel all that impressive. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything to write home about. I liked the cookie pieces and they tasted like little chewy speculoo cookies. The big question is how good is the core? Well This one was a little disappointing. It was ok and did indeed taste like speculoos, but it was also a bit too much. It was warmer than the rest of the ice cream and I felt like I wasn't really eating ice cream. I think alot of people would really enjoy it but I don't think they got the balance right. The Trader Joe's version actually tasted like ice cream with speculoos in it and for me, that gives it the edge. This certainly isn't bad though. It will definitely satisfy most peoples speculoos cravings.

### Going back for more?
Probably not. The Trader Joe's version is better.
