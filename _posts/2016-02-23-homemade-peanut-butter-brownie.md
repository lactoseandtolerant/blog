Time for the holy grail! My first attempt at peanut butter ice cream. I had been putting this off for a while because of my recent run of peanut butter ice cream reviews. No longer! Here it is. It is my first attempt at incorporating a hard swirl mix-in and I also decided to go for a Reece's peanut butter cup vibe and throw in some chocolate brownies.

### Ingredients
Makes approximately 1 quart:

#### Base

* 1 ½ cups of whole milk
* 1 ½ cups of heavy cream
* 2 large egg yolks
* ¾ cup of smooth peanut butter
* ¾ cup of brown sugar
* pinch of salt

<br/>

#### Swirl
* ¼ cup of peanut butter
* 2 tbsp of coconut oil

<br/>

#### Mix-ins
* 1 cup of chopped brownies


### Directions
It goes with out saying, but you will need an ice cream maker for this.

#### Base

1. <span>Combine 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of cream in a pot and simmer on medium low heat.</span>
2. <span>Combine the remaining milk and cream (½ and ½) in a bowl and chill. I had both in the refrigerator so they were already cold.</span>
3. <span>Add ¾ cup of peanut butter to the simmering milk and cream and stir until mixed. Keep an eye on the mixture and stir to avoid the mixture forming a hard skin.</span>
4. <span>In a separate bowl, whisk eggs and brown sugar and salt until completely combined and they start to [ribbon](http://www.bhg.com/videos/m/32071630/beating-eggs-until-ribbons.htm)</span>
5. <span>Temper the egg and sugar mixture with the simmered peanut butter mixture by adding a little at a time while simultaneously whisking. You do not want to scramble your eggs by dumping the entire hot mixture into the eggs and sugar.</span>
6. <span>After you have tempered the egg and sugar mixture with at least half of the peanut butter/milk/cream mixture, combine both mixtures back into your pot and put on low heat.</span>
7. <span>Continuously stir mixture until it thickens. Again, you want to keep a very close eye on the mixture and keep scraping the bottom and edges to keep your eggs from scrambling. Do not allow mixture to boil. You will know when you are done when you can dip a wooden spoon or spatula into the mixture and run your finger across the spoon with the mixture holding the line you drew. This can take a few tries to get down but error on not overcooking you mixture.</span>
8. <span>Turn off your stove and add the remaining cold milk and cream mixture and stir.</span>
9. <span>Refrigerate the custard for at least 6 hours (or overnight).</span>
10. <span>Pour mixture into your ice cream machine and follow the instructions of your ice cream maker.</span>

#### Swirl

1. <span>Combine ¼ cup of peanut butter and 2 tbsp of coconut oil in a microwave safe bowl and heat for 30 seconds</span>
2. <span>Stir and heat for another 30 seconds</span>
3. <span>Repeat until completely combined and set aside</span>

#### Mixing
1. <span>After the base is done churning, remove your paddle and fold in the brownies.</span>
2. <span>Make sure your swirl mixture is still in a liquid state but not too hot.</span>
3. <span>Dip a spoon into the liquid and drizzle it into your ice cream as your are transferring it into your container</span>
4. <span>The swirl will harden after about 20 seconds, feel free to fold your ice cream and drizzle again.</span>

### How did it turn out?
Well this is it. The best peanut butter ice cream I have ever tasted. This guy even beats the [Culinaria's Peanut Butter Cup]({% post_url 2015-12-28-ice-cream-culinaria-pb %}). It tastes very peanut buttery. The swirl turned out great and breaks up the texture a bit. The brownies are also a nice change of pace. I am really happy with this one. It definitely will be making another appearance.
