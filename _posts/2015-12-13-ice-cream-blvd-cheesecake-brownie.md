### First Impression
I got this guy while at Whole Foods. I wasn't really sure what to expect from this flavor combination. I've had a cheesecake ice cream made by Stone Ridge Creamery before and I liked it, so why not?. I was pretty disappointed when I opened the pint. It was missing a healthy chunk of ice cream around the rim. Not a good start

### Texture
It is creamy, I'll give it that but where are my brownie bits? Umm...I kept digging but found only little specs here and there. Disappointing.

### Flavor
There is an artificial note to this ice cream. It almost tastes like "light" ice cream. The little fudge bits also tasted bitter and artificial. I didn't get any cheesecake flavor from this ice cream. All in all, a disappointment.


### Going back for more?
Nope. This pretty much sucked.
