### First Impression
I have been so caught up in making my own ice cream that I haven't bought any brand name pints in the last few months. I decided to switch it up and grabbed this guy from the shelf. It's as close to my [Homemade Triple Chocolate]({% post_url 2016-01-16-homemade-triple-chocolate %}) ice cream as you are gonna get, so what better way to see how my homemade goodness compares to one of my favorite brands. Keep in mind that I generally don't like chocolate ice cream, so this pint already had an uphill climb as soon as I bought it.

### Texture
The base is as thick and smooth as you would expect from Ben & Jerry's. The brownies are gooey and fudgy. In fact they are more fudge than they are brownies. I could already tell that I had become spoiled by my homemade ice cream. While the texture of this ice cream was good by store bought standards, It didn't quite have the creaminess of homemade ice cream. Maybe it's in my mind, but I was a little disappointed.

### Flavor
My biggest complaint with most chocolate ice creams is that they don't really taste like chocolate. They don't give me the same feeling as eating chocolate. It is analogous to banana flavoring reminding one of bananas without actually tasting like real bananas. Sadly, this pint does not rectify that complaint. It isn't terrible. It's just not very good. It tries to replicate darker chocolate and I just wasn't digging it. The fudgy brownie bits weren't too bad but overall I was pretty disappointed with this pint. Especially since it is Ben & Jerry's. It didn't stack up at all to my homemade counterpart.

### Going back for more?
Nope, I'd much rather make it at home
