### First Impression
I am on a bit of a chocolate ice cream quest at the moment and as I have probably written before, I generally don't like chocolate ice cream. They generally tend to taste malty and unconvincing. The gold standard in chocolate ice cream, in my opinion, is Blue Bunny's Chocolate Seduction. It's rich, sweet and full of chocolate chunks and swirls. The only problem is they don't make it anymore. So I have decided to dedicate a few reviews to see if I can find a decent replacement.

I read a little bit about Hostess coming out with ice cream flavors based on their snack cakes. The packaging looks straight out of Edy's factory. I was convinced it was Edy's(which I generally don't like), but people online seemed to like the flavor so I gave it a shot.

### Texture
Yep. Definitely Edy's. It has their signature whipped texture. This guy is fluffly and melts quickly. I generally don't like my ice cream this fluffy but I think it can work as a chocolate flavor. The marshmallow is as stringy and chewy as you would expect.

### Mixins
Pretty standard Edy's stuff here. There is a decent marshmallow swirl and chunks of Hostess cake chunks. The chunks taste more like brownies than cake and are decent at braking up the fluffiness of the ice cream base.

### Flavor
Eh. Again, exactly what you would expect from Edy's ice cream. It's not the worst chocolate flavor in the world. I like that it's a little on the sweet side. If you are going to make chocolate ice cream, go all out on sweetness or go all out on authenticity. Don't straddle the middle. This still falls in the middle but you can tell they are embracing the "fun" inauthentic style of chocolate. The cake chunks are decent and have a fudge brownie taste to them. The marshmallow tastes like marshmallow fluff.

### Buy Again?
Nope. There just isn't a reason to. This pint isn't really outstanding in anyway. The mixins are ok but not crazy. The chocolate flavor is meh, and it's just too fluffy for me.
