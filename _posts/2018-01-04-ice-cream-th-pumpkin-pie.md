### First Impression
I'm back to start the new year with another review. This time it's Turkey Hill's limited edition Pumpkin Pie ice cream. This is actually the second Turkey Hill flavor I have tried. I'll have a review soon on their Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup. Blue Bunny is currently my go-to brand for non super premium ice cream but I have been reading that Turkey Hill brings it. A lot of people like this flavor so let's see how it stacks up.

### Texture
Eh, kinda of fluffy. I wasn't expecting Haagen Daz's thickness but It would have been nice if it were noticeably better than Breyers or Edy's. I do like how creamy it gets though, the texture is reminiscent of a decent Philadelphia style ice cream. The swirl adds a lot of grit, so if that's your thing, you will love it.

### Mixins
Only one mixin....but it is pretty epic. The swirl is a little bonkers. It is very sweet. It might even be a bit too sweet for some, but for just one mixin, it is more than respectable.

### Flavor
I gotta say, while the texture of the base was lacking a bit, they made up for it in flavor. This stuff is pretty good. The base has a pleasant pumpkin flavor. It's not too sweet and isn't overly artificial. You can also taste a bit of cinnamon in there. The swirl is dangerous. It makes this ice cream work. As much I like it though, I think Blue Bunny does a slightly more balanced cinnamon graham cracker swirl. Theirs is not quite as sweet and has a chunkier texture. This swirl is no slouch though. It is quite delicious.

### Buy Again?
Yup, I don't love how fluffy the base is but they nailed everything else.
