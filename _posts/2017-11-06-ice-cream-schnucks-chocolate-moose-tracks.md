### First Impression
I was always curious about Schnucks' regular ice cream offerings. Their Culinaria branded premium stuff was legit but unfortunately, they stopped making them. This guy was only $2.99 and since I was still in the hunt for a new favorite chocolate ice cream I decided to give it a chance.

### Texture
Yuck. Ice, ice, ice. I'm not sure if I got a bum container but the first quarter of this guy was an icy mess. I dug down to give it a real chance and while it improved, it was still pretty gritty. The swirl and cups only added to the choppy, icy, gritty texture.

### Mixins
At least they didn't skimp out on mixins. There is a respectable amount here. The fudge swirl and peanut butter cups can easily be found. It's no Ben and Jerry's but I have seen worse.

### Flavor
Bleh. The initial spoonful was funky. It almost tasted like it was spoiled. I had to dig deep to get an accurate representation of its flavor. It wasn't much better. The peanut butter cups have such a mild taste that you would mistake them for chocolate chips. The fudge swirl was the only half decent flavor of the entire half gallon.with it.

### Buy Again?
Not a chance, a disappointing waste of money.
