### First Impression
So here is the deal. I love cookie butter. I don't eat it all that often but that spicy, sweet, creamy goodness is hard to beat. I actually saw this flavor a few weeks before it came out when I was on an Instacart trial. I went looking all over for this baby but couldn't find it anywhere. I have had several different cookie butter ice creams before with Trader Joe's being the most enjoyable. My excitement and expectations for this flavor were sky high. Let's see if it lived up to it.

### Texture
Signature Blue Bunny. Not as thick or hard as your super premiums but not as soft as the frozen whipped madness Edy's calls ice cream. I actually scooped out of this container right after I had a scoop of Turkey Hills's Pumpkin pie. The difference in thickness was very noticeable. This felt like premium ice cream compared to the Turkey Hill. It would be remiss of me to not mention the gritty swirls of cinnamon graham cracker and chunks of cookie dough. They really add variety to the texture of the ice cream.

### Mixins
Solid. Admirable even. This still isn't a Ben & Jerry's level of mixins, but it is good for a non-super premium. I really like how Blue Bunny does their graham cracker swirls. They really get it throughout the container. There are the aforementioned cookie dough chunks, but there is also a cookie butter caramel swirl. I am a little surprised the calories on this guy isn't higher than 200.

### Flavor
Boom, there it is. They nailed it. The base is definitely cookie butter, but not overwhelming enough to take away from the mixins. The winner here is that graham cracker swirl. Blue Bunny has got this thing down. They had it in their S'mores and Honey Bunny flavors and it only seems to keep getting better. The cookie dough chunks are chewy and delicious. The caramel swirl is ok. I never seem to get excited about their caramel swirls anymore though.

### Buy Again?
Already have. Best cookie butter flavor on the market. This one is a winner. Go out and buy some because it is a limited edition. Hopefully, they bring it back often.
