### First Impression
I was at Target the other day and noticed a buy one get one free sale on all Haagen Dazs ice cream. Haagen Dazs makes some excellent ice cream, but I rarely buy their pints because they are usually so expensive. I took advantage of the sale and bought a pint of Pineapple Coconut and Triple Chocolate Trio. My expectations were simple, this pint would be rich, creamy and hopefully refreshing.

### Texture
The base is creamy. Exactly what one might expect from Haagen Dazs. It wasn't so hard that you had to let it sit out for a few minutes before scooping. The only thing that really broke up the rich creamy smoothness of the base where the small chunks of pineapple.

### Mixins
If you are a big fan of huge chunks of craziness in your ice cream, you will probably be disappointed in this pint. The pint is simple and understated with only a few chunks of pineapple here and there. Those expecting coconut flakes will also be disappointed.

### Flavor
What else can I say other than they nailed the flavor combination. The base is very coconutty(is that a word?). This isn't some mild flavored blue bunny ice cream base. It is sweet, very rich and can probably stand on its own without the need for mixins. It also has a lingering heavy cream mouthfeel that might be appealing to some but not to myself. As much as I love ice cream, I don't care for plain milk nor the taste of heavy cream. This certainly has that heavy cream taste going on. The pineapple chunks were very good. They tasted fresh even though I knew the certainly were not. All in all I think they got the profile just right.

### Buy Again?
Probably not. Haagen Dazs definitely nailed the execution of the flavors but I don't really see myself going out of my way to buy this flavor combination. I love coconuts and I like pineapples, but they are not really something I crave in ice cream. I can't ding Haagen Dazs for that though. They did a good job.
