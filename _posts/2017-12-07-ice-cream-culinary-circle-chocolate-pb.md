### First Impression
I decided to mix it up this time and get a new chocolate ice cream combination. Culinary circle used to make a raspberry cheesecake gelato that had a really nice texture. It wasn't a genuine gelato but it was creamy and smooth. I bought this one hoping the texture would match that previous flavor.

### Texture
Yep. Nailed it. This is a grocery store brand but they have the texture down. It isn't really gelato. It's more like premium ice cream. It's definitely not as dense as the super premiums but it has good thickness and creaminess. The peanut butter blends in nicely. Although you can see the swirl, this tastes more like a combined flavor. It's quite nice.

### Mixins
Eh, nothing really here. This is a bit of a letdown. You can make out the peanut butter swirl but you have to go digging for it. This is where they are likely saving on cost. A got this quart for $3.50 and that price is indicative of the number of mix-ins.

### Flavor
The chocolate base is meh. It's about what I have come to expect from chocolate ice cream. It's barely passable as chocolate but it doesn't really taste like chocolate. The peanut butter is nice and salty, perhaps a bit too salty but still nice. I wish there was more of it.

### Buy Again?
Maybe, but probably not. The flavor is mediocre but they nailed the texture. It might be worth buying another quart alongside some brownies or chocolate chips to throw in there, but not anytime soon.
