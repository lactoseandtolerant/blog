### First Impression
I walk out to the food trucks around downtown often, so I decided to start reviewing them. This is my first such review and since I wrote this after the fact, I didn't take my own pictures. I'll make sure to do so going forward, but for now, the pics are straight from Slide Piece's Facebook page. My initial impression of this truck was that it was a little to slick. I don't expect well designed, modern logos from food trucks so I was a little hesitant. In my humble opinion, food trucks should concentrate on serving tasty interesting foods quickly and not so much on fancy logos and colorful trucks.

### Food
Hesitation aside, I walked up and got one lamb slider, one fried green tomato slider and a side of fries. The sliders are slightly larger than a white castle burger but much higher in quality. The lamb slider was topped with yogurt and apple slices. It was a little disappointing. I wasn't feeling the apple slices on my burger. The fried green tomato on the other hand, was on point. It consisted of mozzeralla, pepperoncini and a balsamic reduction. Looking back, I should have bought two of those instead. The little bag of fries were underwhelming. I think you get more fires from a small order at McDonald's than you do here.

### Value
My biggest issue with this food truck is that it feels like a proof of concept for a swanky burger bar. It doesn't really feel like a food truck food. The price for two burgers and fries was $11. That's pretty steep for a food truck. Most other trucks average around $7 to $8 for a bigger portioned meal. I prefer to spend more money on dinner and not on lunch. The value just wasn't there.

### Going back again?
Nah. The fried green tomato slider is delicious, other than that it was pretty expensive and underwhelming.
