I love french toast and as you can see I like to take pictures of food. I also like to experiment until I have found the "right" way to make them. So, I decided to answer the question: What bread should I use to make french toast.

I have tried breads ranging from sandwich bread to artisanal breads and I can safely say wheaty breads such as Whole Food's Seeduction Bread are a bad idea. I thought that I had finally settled on french bread (specifically Companions Pain Beaucaire), but I got the itch to give Brioche a go. I have read a lot of sites and blogs that recommend either brioche or challah, but I always hesitated because they already have a good amount of egg in them.

I used my standard recipe; two eggs per person; 1/8 a cup of milk per person; one tablespoon of sugar and a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla extract to taste.

So how did the brioche turn out? Well...Meh. It was a little too soft. A little soggy. The center of each slice was a little creamy, probably from the extra egg content. I could imagine using a little more oil or butter to make the outside a little crispy or donut-like.

> Overall...Meh

Honestly, as soon as I took the first bite, I wished I had used the pain beaucaire. It has more structure and can soak up the custard without getting too soggy. Add a little golden syrup and you are good to go. Question answered.
Pain Beaucaire all the way.
