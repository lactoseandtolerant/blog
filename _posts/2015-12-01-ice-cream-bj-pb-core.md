### First Impression
As I mentioned in my [Haagen Das Peanut Butter Pie Review]({% post_url 2015-12-01-ice-cream-haagen-das-peanut-butter-pie %}), I have been on a quest for the best peanut butter ice cream. I actually tried this ice cream before that review, but this is the first time writing about it. The first and likely only impression anyone would have with this ice cream is..."What is that core all about?"

### Texture
It's Ben & Jerry's so you know it is quality. The base is thick. Some Ben & Jerry's ice creams are so thick that you have to let them sit out for a few minutes so you don't bend your spoon. Thankfully this isn't quite as thick but you might have to do a little digging. There are chunks of cakey peanut butter cookie pieces that add a little grit to the overall texture. Then there is the core. Scooping a piece of the core feels almost like scooping shaved ice. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting.

### Flavor
The base is pretty solid. It doesn't have as much peanut butter flavor as the [Haagen Das]({% post_url 2015-12-01-ice-cream-haagen-das-peanut-butter-pie %}). The peanut butter pieces are pretty good and are a nice change of pace. The big deal here is the core. While it has an unexpected texture, It has a killer amount of peanut butter goodness. It packs in so much peanut butter that I can only eat a half of it before I need to stop (I can usually throw down). The core makes this ice cream. It definitely will give you your peanut butter fix.

### Going back for more?
Yes. Dat core!
