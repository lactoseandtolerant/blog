### First Impression
I love Biscoff's Cookie Butter spread but I really didn't know what to expect with this bad boy. It has a vanilla ice cream base with swirls of Speculoos(Belgian cookies). It was hard to get a good feel for anything going on inside until I took a few spoonfuls.

### Texture
I thought I would find the vanilla base boring, but it turned out well. It is definitely on the premium side with little overrun(air whipped in). There are lots of speculoo chunks mixed in, with a sizable concentration in the middle. The speculoos had a chewyness to them that I wasn't expecting.

### Flavor
I haven't had Traders Joe's Speeculo spread before but the speculoo chunks are not as sweet as Biscoff's version. It all works out though, I think if they were that strong it might lead to too much of a sugar rush. The base compliments the sweet ginger-bready taste of the cookie butter. It is a simple but solid combination of both flavors.

### Going back for more?
Already have.
