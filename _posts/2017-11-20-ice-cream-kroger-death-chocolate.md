### First Impression
I am a fan of Kroger's Private Selection brand but they only seem to carry limited flavors at the closest store. They do, however, carry a ton of their less premium deluxe branded ice cream. I am still looking for a decent chocolate ice cream so I decided to give this a whirl and at only $2.50 it was worth a chance

### Texture
I expected Edy's fluffiness, what I got was a little better. This is no premium ice cream but the texture was actually respectable for a non-premium. The base is a little denser than Edy's and it scoops easily straight from the freezer. The mixins are small chunks that don't really affect the texture that much

### Mixins
This half gallon has a respectable amount of mixins. You are likely to get something in each scoop. The only issue is, I am not really sure what that something is. The label doesn't really say what the mixins are. I think it has chocolate chips and almonds but I'm not really sure.

### Flavor
Eh. The base is more on the dark chocolate spectrum but it is pretty bland. I kept waiting for either a sweet or bitter aftertaste but I kept getting nothing. The number of mixins is great but they too are pretty bland.

### Buy Again?
Nope, The quality of the base was decent from a texture standpoint but I just didn't dig the flavor. I will likely try out some of their other flavors though.
