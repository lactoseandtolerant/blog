### First Impression
I've had this ice cream before but I thought it was time to do a proper review. I am on a peanut butter kick at the moment so why not throw this guy into the mix. I am a fan of Blue Bunny. They tend to slot in between the lower quality brands (Breyer's and Edy's) and the premium brands (Ben & Jerry's and Haagen Daz) so my expectations tend to be fairly high for Blue Bunny flavors.

### Texture
This guy was representative of most of Blue Bunny's Ice cream. It was thick but not terribly smooth or creamy. It isn't as scoopable as something you would find out of Haagen Daz. It resembles Ben & Jerry's in its thickness but not quite up there in terms of quality. I got chunks of ice cream rather than a nice curl when scooping with a spoon. There is only a hint of craziness when you initially open the lid but that changes pretty quickly. There are ribbons and swirls of chocolate and peanut butter radiating from the middle that give the ice cream grittiness. The deeper you go down the middle the more swirls you get. It feels like excavating chocolate and peanut butter goodness straight out of a rock face.

### Flavor
The flavor of the peanut butter base was a big letdown. I barely tasted any peanut butter. It was more like vanilla with a hint of peanut butter. If this review was based primarily on the base, it wouldn't cut it. Luckily Blue Bunny threw in a crap ton of swirls in here. This ice cream probably has the highest concentration of swirls I have seen and it gets crazier the deeper you go. The peanut butter swirl is a little salty but balances the nice chocolate swirls. This guy ended up holding its own.

### Going back for more?
Maybe, I have bought it multiple times. It isn't the best peanut butter ice cream out there but it is pretty crazy with all the mixins.
