I love ice cream...perhaps a bit too much. Unforunatley I am also lactose intolerant so I have to walk the line between delicious ice cream goodness and well...you know how it goes.
I also love rating things so naturally I started this blog to catalog the many different flavors I run across. If you like this blog, or have any ideas to improve it, drop me a line at chikeorjih@gmail.com.
